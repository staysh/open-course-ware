# Open Source Course Design

The idea behind this repo is that it will store not only the non-video course content for courses deisgned for the PCC open source course initiative but also prototypes of software tools/approaches and technical documentation on topics like batch creating video content and thinking about open source eductational content in general. In addition to backing up and storing course content it allows that content to be point-and-click broweseable by generating styled pages that are more comfortable to read than plain text. 


### Structure
As of now the structure of this repository is imagined as such:

```
open-course-ware
|__Code
|  |__software-project
|  |  |__docs
|  |
|  |__other project...  
|
|__Courses
|  |__AI&ML
|  |  |__Overview
|  |  |__Module-1-Title
|  |  |  |__Outline/Script

|  |  |__Module-2-...
|  |  
|  |__Other Courses...
|
|__Parking Lot
   |__links to resources
   |__unformatted content
   |__etc
```
